This is a small static prototype of the Virtual Labs page styled to resemble the screenshot you provided.

Files created:
- index.html — main page
- styles.css — styles used by the page
- assets/logo.svg — placeholder logo
- assets/mindmap.svg — placeholder mind map image (replace with your actual mind map)

How to view:
Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or right-click -> Open with > your browser).

Notes:
- The header nav buttons (Home, Partners, Contact) were removed per your request.
- The left sidebar now only shows "List of experiments" and "Feedback".
- Replace `assets/mindmap.svg` with your own mind map image (keep the filename) to update the displayed mind map.
